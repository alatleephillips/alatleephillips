# Hey there, I'm Alex Phillips! 

> "People think of education as something they can finish" - Isaac Asimov 

Like one of my favorite science fiction writers, I'm always learning. Currently, I'm trying to learn R, HTML, and CSS. I have no idea what I'm doing, but that's okay!

### Some things about me! 

- 🎞 | I'm a professional photographer! I love to photograph weddings, engagements, families, and basically anything with people. I also love to shoot on film and collect antique cameras. You can see my work on my [website](www.alexphillipsphoto.com). 

- 🚴‍♀️ | I collect outdoor hobbies! I love to do a lot of different sports outside, like climbing, tennis, volleyball, ocean swimming, biking, skiing, and trail running. Let's be friends on [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/43089239)! 

- 🗒 | I am passionate about science communication, especially as a tool for improving DEI in STEM. I founded the project [Women Doing Science](www.womendoingscience) and wrote an (open access!) [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221113068) on its impact.
